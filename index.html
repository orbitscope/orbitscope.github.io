        <p>We are in the research and development phase for production of small satellites and a streaming service to give you live, interactive surround video from low Earth orbit.</p>
        <p>You'll be able to tap into the stream whenever you want, and since the entire surround video data will be streamed, any number of people around the world will be able to simultaneously explore the wonders of our planet, and beyond...</p>
        <p>Our goal is full support for an immersive, head-tracked virtual reality experience with ethereal audio accompaniment. When we go live, we aim to also provide an in-browser, live 2d experience for those without VR headsets.</p>
